	Welch Two Sample t-test

data:  incidents by period
t = -0.82087, df = 37.991, p-value = 0.4168
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -13.518049   5.718049
sample estimates:
mean in group 60 mean in group 75 
            6.95            10.85 
#p value greater than 0.05, therefore there is no difference in means
