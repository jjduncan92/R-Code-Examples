#breast cancer example. Is there a significant difference between the radius_mean of patients diagnosed B and M?

#lets plot a linear model using some of the predictors:
#use radius mean (which is highly correlated with both perimeter mean and area mean so we reduce),texture, and compactness
ggplot()+geom_boxplot(data=mydata,aes(x=diagnosis,y=radius_mean))
#appears that there is a difference between tumour sizes in B and M diagnoses

#test for normality using shapiro 
str(mydata$radius_mean[mydata$diagnosis=="B"])
str(mydata$radius_mean[mydata$diagnosis=="M"])
shapiro.test(mydata$radius_mean[mydata$diagnosis=="B"]) #p>0.05 so the benign data is normally distributed
shapiro.test(mydata$radius_mean[mydata$diagnosis=="M"]) #p<0.05, so the malignant data is not normally distributed

#use the kruskal-wallis test for the data
kruskal.test(data=mydata,diagnosis~radius_mean) #p<0.05 so there is a difference
#to get a better p value, use the post-hoc test Tukey-Kramer
library(DTK)
myTK<-TK.test(x=mydata$radius_mean,f=mydata$diagnosis)
myTK #adjusted p value is zero, so the means differ significantly between diagnosis (we can conclude this since diagnosis only has 2 factors)
plot(myTK) #the 95% confidence interval for the difference, note that it does not include zero

#lets look at the next set of predictors
pairs.panels(mydata[c(2,9:15)])
#most correlation with diagnosis is with concavity, points, radius_se, and perimeter_se
#since concavity and points are highly correlated, only use points
